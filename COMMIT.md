Switching variants updates prices
- This is a big commit with lotso important changes
- For product-card.liquid, the elements that used to only render depending on active_variant properties now show up regardless
  - That includes .badge-sale, .price-discounted, and .price-discounted-percentage
  - It used to be that these will only show up specifically if compare_at_price > price, aka if the active variant is on discount
  - This had to be overhauled for a reason I'll explain in a bit
- The biggest chunk is of course the variant-swatch.js processing
  - Fetches the comparePrice and actualPrice values
  - Fetches the HTML DOM of .price-original, .price-discounted, .price-discounted-percentage, and .badge-sale
  - Checks to see if there's a discount
    - If yes
      - We update .price-original content and add the .discounted class, which adds a strike-through to the text
      - We update .price-discounted content
      - We calculate for discountPercentage and update .price-discounted-percentage content
      - We remove .hidden class from badgeSale, which means the badgeSale will show up
    - Otherwise
      - We update .price-original content and remove the .discounted class, so no more strike-through
      - We leave .price-discounted blank
      - We leave .price-discounted-percentage blank
      - We add .hidden class to badgeSale, which means the badgeSale will no longer show up
- So the reason why the elements had to show up on liquid render is there may be products that have a combination of variants where some are discounted and some aren't, so this solution accommodates those scenarios by leaving the elements in, regardless if they're gonna be empty
- Finally, Shopify.formatMoney() is the one suggested by the scripts I found online and by GPT as a JS alternative to money filter, but of course that doesn't work cuz my JS doesn't know where to get that function, so I had GPT create a good enough formatMoney() function script, and had it imported as a JS file
