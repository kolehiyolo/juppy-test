Install Tailwind
- Bruh it worked after so much finagling
- Things done:
  - Installed tailwind and tailwind-cli via NPM
  - Created a concurrently script that runs both "shopify theme dev" and the --watch command that processes tailwind.input.css into tailwind.output.css
  - Linked tailwind.output.css to theme.liquid as a stylesheet
  - Included node stuff in .shopifyignore
  - To test if it's working, I remade .badge-sale to use tailwind classes and omitted the CSS entirely
- I also set up a shopify.theme.toml file, so I can apparently run a development environment for the theme, but I just did it cuz the tutorial I followed did it lol
  - I honestly am not privy yet to the importance of setting up development environments, but I can kinda imagine a vague sense of the use cases
  - I'm keeping it for now
