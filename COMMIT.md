Create test-section MVP, .liquid with {% stylesheet %}
- test-section.liquid is ready, with placeholder content for products, and basic but good enough styling
- Rendered test-section.liquid in index.json, replacing hello-world.liquid
- Caveats
  - I wanted to make my own .json template, which is the "demo" page that was the final deliverable, but I Was running into issues making it work
    - I decided to push this somewhere in the later stages of the project, and I made do with rendering the section in index.json
  - The way this Skeleton theme handles max-width containers is so unorthodox and honestly very unintuitive, but as it is the standard (it seems) throughout the theme, I'll be using it for now
