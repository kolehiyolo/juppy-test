product-card is a block
- product-card is now a block, still using placeholder content
- Updated test-section.liquid to allow/accept @theme blocks, with max 3
- Caveats
  - I so wanted it so that product-card is the only @theme block accepted by test-section.liquid, but for some reason, when I do so, regardless of how I try to render the blocks content, it isn't showing up
  - I added it to the growing list of things I'd like to revisit in the latest stages of the project
