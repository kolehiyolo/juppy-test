Variant swatches rendering from arrays
- I'm supposed to be styling but I instead jumped to this part
- The idea here is that the variant swatches are being rendered dependent on the array/object data of the variants for the product, and it's already somewhat working
- I hate the fact that the variant names and hexes aren't just combined in a variant object, but we'll deal with that later when we introduce actually pulling live data
